# Splitting Names
To help personalise our mailshots we want to have the first name and last name of the customer.
Unfortunately the customer data that we are supplied only contains full names.

The system therefore attempts to break a supplied full name into its constituents by splitting
around whitespace.

### Example
The full name Jane Smith is broken into first name Jane and last name Smith.
